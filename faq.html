     <h2>What is hakkerileiri?</h2>
     <p>Hakkerileiri draws its inspiration from international hacker camps, such as <href="https://why2025.org/" target="_blank">Why</a>. A hacker camp is
a multi-day, outdoor, community-organized gathering where hackers, engineers, and technology enthusiasts spend time outdoors, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects of their interest. The camp is created by its participants. You are welcome to bring your own project and share it with others, give a talk on your favorite topic or arrange a workshop on something that makes your heart sing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXOnuMGKDd8" target="_blank">Have a look at this video from 'May Contain Hackers 2022' camp explaining it more visually</a>. </p><br><br>

      <h2>Where and when is it?</h2>
      <p>The camp is organized at a recreational site on the shore of Lake Saimaa 10-14.8.2026</p><br><br>

      <h2>Finnish summers are unpredictable. Do I have to sleep in a tent?</h2>
      <p>You can if you want to, but there are also cabins available that you can share with a group of friends.</p><br><br>
      
     <h2>How many participants will there be?</h2>
     <p>100 hackers.</p><br><br>
     
     <h2>Only a 100? Why so few spots?</h2>
     <p>Running a camp is very different from hosting indoor events, and this is our first public hacker camp. To make sure everyone has a safe, enjoyable experience, we’re starting small with 100 participants and focusing on doing things right rather than doing things big.</p><br><br>
     
     <h2>How can I participate?</h2>
     <p>We will let you know. Ticket sales will begin in April. Follow this webpage and our social media <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hakkerileiri" target="_blank" >Instagram</a> || <a href="https://some.hacklab.fi/@hakkerileiri" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. You can also <a href="sponsors.html" target="_blank">sponsor us</a>.</p><br><br>
     
      <h2>How much will it cost?</h2>
      <p>The price of the camp depends on the quality and type of accommodation you choose. Tent accommodation is more affordable, while cabins come at a higher price. As a rough estimate, attending the full camp and staying in a cabin with a group of friends would cost around €400 per person.</p><br><br>
  
      <h2>Can I become a volunteer?</h2>
     <p>The camp is organized by its participants so basically everyone is a volunteer. There is a small group of "super enthusiasts" who are, for example, maintaining this website but everybody pays the same price for their participation. </p>
